                                <review_text>Chicken Shawarma

Ingredients for four people:
Chicken fillet 400 g
Parsley 50 g
Pickled cucumber 6
Potatoes (optional) 2
Pita bread 4 (or as needed)
Olive oil 3 tbsp
Onion 1
Parmesan cheese 100 g
Salt 2 tbsp
Turmeric 1 tsp
Ground black pepper 2 tsp
Garlic powder 2 tsp

Ingredients for tahini sauce:
Thick yogurt 4 tbsp
Mayonnaise 1 tbsp
Tahini 1 tbsp
Fresh lemon juice 3 tbsp
Garlic 1
Salt 1 tsp (or to taste)
Ground black pepper ½ tsp (or to taste)

Wash the chicken fillet, take the chicken skin off and slice them into strips. Add them to a mixing bowl.

Mix up the salt, turmeric, black pepper, and garlic powder. Add them along with the olive oil to the Chicken and massage the seasoning into the chicken fillets.

Cut the onion into slices and add them to the Chicken. Mix everything together.

Cover the Chicken with a plastic film and let it sit in the fridge for at least an hour. Chilling the mixture will marinate the Chicken and infuse it with flavor.

While the Chicken is marinating, prepare the tahini sauce. For this purpose, pour the thick yogurt with mayonnaise, tahini, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper into a suitable bowl.

Finely grate the garlic and add it to the bowl. Then mix until the sauce is uniform. Note that the sauce should be as thick as porridge.

Now put a suitable pan on low heat and coat it with oil. Once the oil is hot enough, add the marinated chicken fillets into the pan and sauté until the fillets change color.

Meanwhile, you can fry the potatoes. Slice the potato lengthwise to your desired thickness.

Put a pan on the heat and add two to three tablespoons of oil. Then fry the potatoes in oil over medium heat until they get golden.

Wash the parsley and drain the excess water. Now transfer them to a tray and chop them finely.

Place the pita bread on your tray. Take the tahini sauce and spread it on the center of the bread.

Pile a layer of the chicken fillets, fried potatoes, chopped pickles, parsley, and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese on the bread and roll it. You can top the ingredient with tahini sauce if you like.

At this stage, preheat the sandwich maker, then roast the shawarmas in the machine. In the absence of a sandwich maker, place an unoiled grill pan on medium heat and put the shawarmas in the pan. Then put a heavy object on them to grill them thoroughly.

Once the shawarmas are roasted, and the bread is crispy, cut them in half and put them in your desired dish. You do not have to eat shawarma with bread if you want to stay away from carbohydrates, and you can serve them with salad or plain.

Enjoy your meal!</review_text>

                                <review_text>Over 5000 hours. Took a 9 month break from the game recently due to the incessant cheating. First 5 days back were good, maybe 1 cheater the whole time. Played last night and at least 50 % of the players were using recoil hacks and radar hacks with about 10 % straight up aimbotting. Its a real shame because this game is amazing but Jesus the cheating is reaching comical levels. After playing for over 6 years I thought "how hard is it to apply these cheats" so I googled 'PUBG cheats' found a webpage with all the cheats, created a fake account and applied recoil hack and radar. Obviously I didn't use these hacks on anyone I just wanted to see how accessible and easy they were to apply. 

Took me 30 minutes to find and apply them, the radar here basically shows the names of other players and locations like in replays. The recoil hack takes a bit of adjusting, you basically you have to change 3 parameters for each weapon you use in game and holy moly I realised just how ubiquitously this cheat has been used, I could fire DMR's as fast as I could click, when adjusted correctly for the weapon and attachments there is 0 recoil. You may notice that certain weapons are popular at certain times, this isn't because of a balancing issue this is because the recoil hack works best or only works with certain guns.

A lot of you may already know this but this is for newer players who are giving this game a try or may have trouble distinguishing a skilled player from one who is cheating. The biggest problem is a lot skilled players are using these cheats as well making it very hard to tell if you were outsmarted or the enemy was lucky. DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS GAME.</review_text>

                                <review_text>Better than ever in 2023. Game has a pretty steep skill curve as most players are relatively decent at this point. Best gunplay out of almost any shooter. Movement & Aiming isn't easy. Contrary to popular believe cheaters in this game are not super common. Usually skill issue. Recommend squad > duo > solo. Solos can be very frustrating due to the nature of pubg players being scared and afraid of pushing which leads to camping and hiding. Overall the best battle royale game currently out there. 

One of the few games that still gets my blood pumping. Highly recommend it.</review_text>

                                <review_text>Chicken Shawarma

Ingredients for four people:
Chicken fillet 400 g
Parsley 50 g
Pickled cucumber 6
Potatoes (optional) 2
Pita bread 4 (or as needed)
Olive oil 3 tbsp
Onion 1
Parmesan cheese 100 g
Salt 2 tbsp
Turmeric 1 tsp
Ground black pepper 2 tsp
Garlic powder 2 tsp

Ingredients for tahini sauce:
Thick yogurt 4 tbsp
Mayonnaise 1 tbsp
Tahini 1 tbsp
Fresh lemon juice 3 tbsp
Garlic 1
Salt 1 tsp (or to taste)
Ground black pepper ½ tsp (or to taste)

Wash the chicken fillet, take the chicken skin off and slice them into strips. Add them to a mixing bowl.

Mix up the salt, turmeric, black pepper, and garlic powder. Add them along with the olive oil to the Chicken and massage the seasoning into the chicken fillets.

Cut the onion into slices and add them to the Chicken. Mix everything together.

Cover the Chicken with a plastic film and let it sit in the fridge for at least an hour. Chilling the mixture will marinate the Chicken and infuse it with flavor.

While the Chicken is marinating, prepare the tahini sauce. For this purpose, pour the thick yogurt with mayonnaise, tahini, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper into a suitable bowl.

Finely grate the garlic and add it to the bowl. Then mix until the sauce is uniform. Note that the sauce should be as thick as porridge.

Now put a suitable pan on low heat and coat it with oil. Once the oil is hot enough, add the marinated chicken fillets into the pan and sauté until the fillets change color.

Meanwhile, you can fry the potatoes. Slice the potato lengthwise to your desired thickness.

Put a pan on the heat and add two to three tablespoons of oil. Then fry the potatoes in oil over medium heat until they get golden.

Wash the parsley and drain the excess water. Now transfer them to a tray and chop them finely.

Place the pita bread on your tray. Take the tahini sauce and spread it on the center of the bread.

Pile a layer of the chicken fillets, fried potatoes, chopped pickles, parsley, and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese on the bread and roll it. You can top the ingredient with tahini sauce if you like.

At this stage, preheat the sandwich maker, then roast the shawarmas in the machine. In the absence of a sandwich maker, place an unoiled grill pan on medium heat and put the shawarmas in the pan. Then put a heavy object on them to grill them thoroughly.

Once the shawarmas are roasted, and the bread is crispy, cut them in half and put them in your desired dish. You do not have to eat shawarma with bread if you want to stay away from carbohydrates, and you can serve them with salad or plain.

Enjoy your meal!</review_text>

                                <review_text>Over 5000 hours. Took a 9 month break from the game recently due to the incessant cheating. First 5 days back were good, maybe 1 cheater the whole time. Played last night and at least 50 % of the players were using recoil hacks and radar hacks with about 10 % straight up aimbotting. Its a real shame because this game is amazing but Jesus the cheating is reaching comical levels. After playing for over 6 years I thought "how hard is it to apply these cheats" so I googled 'PUBG cheats' found a webpage with all the cheats, created a fake account and applied recoil hack and radar. Obviously I didn't use these hacks on anyone I just wanted to see how accessible and easy they were to apply. 

Took me 30 minutes to find and apply them, the radar here basically shows the names of other players and locations like in replays. The recoil hack takes a bit of adjusting, you basically you have to change 3 parameters for each weapon you use in game and holy moly I realised just how ubiquitously this cheat has been used, I could fire DMR's as fast as I could click, when adjusted correctly for the weapon and attachments there is 0 recoil. You may notice that certain weapons are popular at certain times, this isn't because of a balancing issue this is because the recoil hack works best or only works with certain guns.

A lot of you may already know this but this is for newer players who are giving this game a try or may have trouble distinguishing a skilled player from one who is cheating. The biggest problem is a lot skilled players are using these cheats as well making it very hard to tell if you were outsmarted or the enemy was lucky. DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS GAME.</review_text>

                                <review_text>Better than ever in 2023. Game has a pretty steep skill curve as most players are relatively decent at this point. Best gunplay out of almost any shooter. Movement & Aiming isn't easy. Contrary to popular believe cheaters in this game are not super common. Usually skill issue. Recommend squad > duo > solo. Solos can be very frustrating due to the nature of pubg players being scared and afraid of pushing which leads to camping and hiding. Overall the best battle royale game currently out there. 

One of the few games that still gets my blood pumping. Highly recommend it.</review_text>

Played last night and at least 50 % of the players were using recoil hacks and radar hacks with about 10 % straight up aimbotting. Its a real shame because this game is amazing but Jesus the cheating is reaching comical levels. After playing for over 6 years I thought "how hard is it to apply these cheats" so I googled 'PUBG cheats' found a webpage with all the cheats, created a fake account and applied recoil hack and radar. Obviously I didn't use these hacks on anyone I just wanted to see how accessible and easy they were to apply. 

Took me 30 minutes to find and apply them, the radar here basically shows the names of other players and locations like in replays. The recoil hack takes a bit of adjusting, you basically you have to change 3 parameters for each weapon you use in game and holy moly I realised just how ubiquitously this cheat has been used, I could fire DMR's as fast as I could click, when adjusted correctly for the weapon and attachments there is 0 recoil. You may notice that certain weapons are popular at certain times, this isn't because of a balancing issue this is because the recoil hack works best or only works with certain guns.

A lot of you may already know this but this is for newer players who are giving this game a try or may have trouble distinguishing a skilled player from one who is cheating. The biggest problem is a lot skilled players are using these cheats as well making it very hard to tell if you were outsmarted or the enemy was lucky. DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS GAME.</review_text>

                                <review_text>Better than ever in 2023. Game has a pretty steep skill curve as most players are relatively decent at this point. Best gunplay out of almost any shooter. Movement & Aiming isn't easy. Contrary to popular believe cheaters in this game are not super common. Usually skill issue. Recommend squad > duo > solo. Solos can be very frustrating due to the nature of pubg players being scared and afraid of pushing which leads to camping and hiding. Overall the best battle royale game currently out there. 

One of the few games that still gets my blood pumping. Highly recommend it.</review_text>

                                <review_text>I will preface my review on what I was wanting out of this game before I give my opinion: I wanted a game I could enter into without needing a degree to understand, that isn't particularly deep to start with but has more complexity if I wish to get more involved and that provides me a mindless relaxing grind to waste some hours and a plot I can pretty much ignore. 

New World meets ALL these requirements I had for a relaxing casual time killer. The game is mid at best but it is so easy to understand and immediately start playing it is ideal for a casual like me who really isn't that invested or expecting to be playing this game in a years time. 

I watch content on YouTube while playing this, I ignore every bit of dialogue and only do what I feel like doing and it all works perfectly well and I do appreciate that. As I said, the game is actually pretty mid and dare I say a bit soulless but it also doesn't ask a lot of the player and is ideal for a casual who just wants to MMO without constantly having to go online to figure out how to do basic things. I actually wanted to try ESO again but when I started it up a few months ago I had totally forgotten just about everything and I could not muster up the energy to bother doing it all over again but I feel I could stop playing this game for a year and pick it up again with no real issue. 

The game runs fine for me, it looks pretty nice at times but not amazing which is expected as they obviously want to have it playable on even the lowest end PC. I encountered a few minor bugs here and there but nothing that re-loading into the server didn't fix. 

I am no MMO expert so I wont even pretend to be an authority on these games but for what I wanted out of this game it is perfectly adequate and mediocre and so far I have enjoyed it, even if I cant say I love it.</review_text>
